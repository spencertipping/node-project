You probably don't want to use this project. It's built on self-modifying Perl,
which is possibly the least usable piece of software I've written.

But, if you really want to use it:

$ mkdir ~/project
$ cp node-project ~/project
$ cd ~/project
$ ./node-project init
$ ./node-project test
$ ./node-project run
$ ./node-project run-forever
^C
$ ./node-project sources edit           # Edit the source files that get included
$ ./node-project libraries edit         # Edit libraries that get downloaded
$ ./node-project lib                    # Re-download libraries
$ ./node-project main = something-else.js
